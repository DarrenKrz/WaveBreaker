WaveBreaker is a one versus one game where players pass a wave back and forth with precise timings. If a player fails to return the wave, they take damage proportional to the velocity of the wave. Win the game by reducing your opponents health to zero.

**Game Info:**  
The wave has three forms corresponding to different velocity thresholds, the wave starts at 1 damage, increasing by one for each further form.  
The playing field is divided into three zones on each side. The zone in which you return the wave will correspond to the cooldown you recieve before being able to make a consecutive return, as well as the amount of force you are stacking up for the return.
Returning the wave in the first zone comes with the greatest penalty being a 2 second delay, whilst the middle has a penalty of 1 second. Only by returning the wave in the final zone are you rewarded with no cooldown before being able to return the wave again.  
These zones also reward you with ripple, a currency used to purchase items in the shop. After a player takes damage, both players will have an opportunity to spend their acquired ripple at the shop.
